# TheCurryPocket

A personal modpack by me, basically just some mods that I'm interested in mixed together, and also tweaked in my own way.<br/>
The MAIN PURPOSE of this modpack is QOL & relaxation, so there will be minimum amount of tweaks, whatever.<br/>
This pack may also contains some features or sth that I want to test or put in my big project: [Herodotus](https://github.com/ProjectHDS/Herodotus).<br/>
The scripts are a huge mess, might clean it up in the future. And also, unless you are ready to be annoyed to death, don’t refer to **ANY** of my code.<br/>
However, **don't take this pack so seriously**.<br/>
